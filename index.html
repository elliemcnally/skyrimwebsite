  <h1>A Study of <i>Skyrim</i> by Bethesda: the Roles of Sounds and Images in the Game</h1>
  <img src="skyrimbg1.jpg">
  <br>In this site I will to explore the use of audio in Bethesda's <i>Skyrim</i>The skyrim soundtrack, 
    composed by Jermey Soule, creates an atmosphere 
  unattainable without it.</br> 
  <h2>𖤓Game Play𖤓</h2>
  <br> Skyrim is an open world role-playing game developed by Bethesda Studios in 2011.</br>
  <p>The story focuses on the player characters journey to defeat Alduin the World-Eater and 
    help the inhabitants of the game world of Tamriel.The soundtrack is not only immersive, 
    but nostagic for those having played the game. Every composition reminds the player of a 
    notable moment or atmosphere, bringing fantasy to life.</p>
  <p>The story of the game is also completly optional to complete. The player may choose to 
  complete the main questline or simply wander the world as they please, the game ends when 
  the player is done with the experience. As Skryim is an open-world roleplaying game, the 
  player can choose their own adventure, sideing with whomever they choose.</p>
  <h3> 𖤓 Secunda 𖤓 </h3>
  <br> The first audio example I have chosen is <i>Secunda</i>, this piece plays exclusively at night 
  while in the open world. </br>
  <br> <audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="Secunda.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio></br>
	<br> The atmospheric music in Skyrim  
  in <i>Secunda</i>(note 1).</br><br> ..
  <h4> 𖤓 Caught Off Guard 𖤓 </h4>
  <br>The second example I have chosen is <i>Caught Off Guard</i>. When the player character is ambushed by a enemy, this track plays. </br>
<br>game and audio explanation (note 2).</br> 
<br> <br> <audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="Caught off Guard.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
