      <br>In this site I will to explore the use of audio in Bethesda's <i>Skyrim</i>The skyrim soundtrack, 
    composed by Jermey Soule, creates an atmosphere unattainable without it.</br>   
<section class="audio-section">
  <h2>𖤓 Secunda 𖤓</h2>
  <audio controls>
    <source src="Secunda.mp3">
  </audio>
  <p>The first audio example I have chosen is <i>Secunda</i>, this piece plays exclusively at night 
  while in the open world.</p>
  <h2>𖤓 Caught Off Guard 𖤓</h2>
	<p>The second example I have chosen is <i>Caught Off Guard</i>. When the player character is ambushed 
  by a enemy, this track plays. </p>

      <h2>𖤓 Game Play 𖤓</h2>
      Skyrim is an open world role-playing game developed by Bethesda Studios in 2011.</br>
  <p>The story focuses on the player characters journey to defeat Alduin the World-Eater and 
    help the inhabitants of the game world of Tamriel.The soundtrack is not only immersive, 
    but nostagic for those having played the game. Every composition reminds the player of a 
    notable moment or atmosphere, bringing fantasy to life.</p>
  <p>The story of the game is also completly optional to complete. The player may choose to 
  complete the main questline or simply wander the world as they please, the game ends when 
  the player is done with the experience. As Skryim is an open-world roleplaying game, the 
  player can choose their own adventure, sideing with whomever they choose.</p>

  			<h2>𖤓 Barthes' "The Reality Effect" 𖤓 </h2>
			<p> In <i>The Reality Effect</i> Barthes illustrates the importance of small, innocuous details. These details have no
			affect on how the game is played or how it is interpreted, they are simply there to complete an environment. Skyrim is
			full of these little details. NPCs will often speak throwaway lines, barrels in crypts will have fresh produce inside, 
			even the loading screens give little anecdotes.</p>
