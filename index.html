<h2>ð–¤“ Barthes' "The Reality Effect" ð–¤“ </h2>
<br> In <i>The Reality Effect</i> Barthes illustrates the importance of small, innocuous details. These details have no
affect on how the game is played or how it is interpreted, they are simply there to complete an environment. Skyrim is
full of these little details. NPCs will often speak throwaway lines, barrels in crypts will have fresh produce inside, 
even the loading screens give little anecdotes.</br>

      <h2>ð–¤“ Game Play ð–¤“</h2>
      Skyrim is an open world role-playing game developed by Bethesda Studios in 2011.</br>
  <p>The story focuses on the player characters journey to defeat Alduin the World-Eater and 
    help the inhabitants of the game world of Tamriel.The soundtrack is not only immersive, 
    but nostagic for those having played the game. Every composition reminds the player of a 
    notable moment or atmosphere, bringing fantasy to life.</p>
  <p>The story of the game is also completly optional to complete. The player may choose to 
  complete the main questline or simply wander the world as they please, the game ends when 
  the player is done with the experience. As Skryim is an open-world roleplaying game, the 
  player can choose their own adventure, sideing with whomever they choose.</p>

      <h2>Why "Hazy Days" Matters</h2>
      <p>Air pollution steals breath, health, and hope from countless lives, and Hazy Days captures this struggle with heart-wrenching clarity. The game is not just a simulation, it is a cry for awareness, empathy, and change. It teaches us that what we take for granted, like clean air, is a dream for many. Through Xiao Fengâ€™s journey, players feel the weight of each breath, reminding us of our shared humanity and responsibility.</p>

      <h2>Visual Aesthetics</h2>
      <p>The gameâ€™s visuals blend simplicity and emotional depth. Its muted palette and soft edges evoke a poignant sense of despair and beauty, mirroring the fragile balance between life and the toxic environment. Xiao Fengâ€™s delicate figure against the smog-heavy backdrop tells a silent but powerful story of resilience.</p>

      <h2>Mini Games in Hazy Days</h2>
      <p><strong>Breathing Control:</strong> This mini-game challenges players to guide Xiao Feng through the treacherous streets filled with smog. Every breath matters, and every inhale of polluted air weighs heavily on her health. It is a stark reminder of how pollution affects even the most basic human function.</p>
      <p><strong>Home Activities:</strong> Even at home, Xiao Feng isnâ€™t safe from the invisible threat of pollution. This mini-game portrays the constant vigilance required to maintain health indoors, as players manage her activities like eating and studying while monitoring air quality levels.</p>
      <p><strong>School Commute:</strong> Xiao Fengâ€™s journey to school is fraught with obstacles, from crowded buses to polluted streets. This mini-game emphasizes how the environment seeps into every aspect of daily life, turning ordinary routines into perilous challenges.</p>
      <p><strong>Health Monitoring:</strong> In this mini-game, players must make critical decisions to protect Xiao Fengâ€™s health. Balancing rest, activity, and exposure to pollution, it paints a vivid picture of the cumulative impact of living in such conditions, leaving players deeply moved by her resilience.</p>

      <h2>Relations to Outside Readings</h2>
      <p><strong>German Expressionism:</strong> The visuals of Hazy Days echo the artistic movement of German Expressionism, where exaggerated forms and stark contrasts convey profound emotional truths. The gameâ€™s muted tones and haunting landscapes reflect the oppressive environment, much like the unsettling atmospheres in films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Kracauer 1947). Both use their aesthetics to externalize inner turmoil, making the unseen, whether itâ€™s pollution or psychological despair, tangible and deeply impactful.</p>
      <p><strong>Persistence in Puzzle-Solving:</strong> Lindleyâ€™s observation on how emotions impact persistence in solving puzzles finds resonance in Hazy Days. The gameâ€™s difficulty often leads to failure, with Xiao Feng becoming sick if players falter (Lindley 2020). This emotional consequence drives persistence, as players feel a personal responsibility for her well-being. The stakes are not just mechanical success but the poignant reality of her health, amplifying the gameâ€™s immersive and educational impact.</p>
      <p><strong>The Pleasure Principle:</strong> Freudâ€™s Pleasure Principle, which emphasizes the human drive to avoid pain and seek immediate gratification, is subverted in Hazy Days. Players are drawn into a world where gratification is replaced by the necessity to endure and adapt. The game highlights how survival in polluted environments demands sacrificing comfort, making the player confront harsh realities rather than escape them (Freud 1920). This juxtaposition deepens the emotional engagement and reinforces the gameâ€™s sobering message.</p>
